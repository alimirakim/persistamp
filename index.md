## About Persistamp

[[ WEBSITE: https://persistamp.herokuapp.com ]](https://persistamp.herokuapp.com)  
*(Inspired by mobile app [Loop Habit Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en_US&gl=US).)*

</div>
<img src="readme/images/persistamp-1.gif" alt="Animated GIF of a program card for chore-related habits." width="50%" align="left">

Persistamp's design is inspired by reward cards and sticker reward systems. The visually playful 'program card' system, emulating the style of loyalty reward cards, is meant to encourage users to track their habits by 'stamping' successful days on their personalized cards. The user can view each habit's history analytics, such as a line graph, calendar, and statistics like longest streak.

With each stamp, the user gains points for the program the habit is included in. A program's reward shop can be stocked by the user with their own custom reward ideas ex. 'Take a day off', 'Enjoy a pumpkin spice latte', 'Play games for 1 hour', and set their cost, quantity, and custom color/icon appearance. Redeemed rewards are displayed for posterity in a receipt-style log as 'proof of their purchase'.

<br clear="both">

## Features
</div>

* Create custom categories for habits with 'program cards'.
* Add habits to programs, then stamp off every day a habit is fulfilled. 
* Set a habit's 'frequency'. Checkmarks will show when the week's goal is fulfilled.
* Earn a 'reward point' for every habit stamp.
* View a habit's history analytics through provided statistics, a line graph, and mini-calendar.
* Share a habit's details or keep it private with a 'Public-Private' toggle.
* Each program features a reward shop. Create rewards with a custom cost and (opt) quantity.
* Use a program's points to redeem rewards. See it logged in a redemption history.
* Customize the appearance of programs, habits, and rewards with a choice of color and icon.
<!-- * Drag-n-drop to manually sort programs, habits, and rewards. -->

### Future Stretch Goals
- **Add friends**
- **Accountability buddies**
- **Messaging**
- User Profile page
- Public/private user profile, programs
- Custom frequency options to allow from 'out of any number', rather than only by 'week'. Ex. '3 days out of 30'.
- (low) Option to archive and hide-archive habits.

- To **add a stamp**, click empty spots in the habit card to mark the day fulfilled for that habit.
- To **undo a stamp**, reclick the stamp.
- With enough stamps for a **habit's frequency goal**, any unstamped spots will now **show a checkmark**.
- ***Warning!** You can only add stamps for within the last seven days, so check in at least once a week.*

- **See previously redeemed rewards**, including when they were redeemed, in the shop's Reward History.
- Indulge yourself in your redeemed reward, or show the receipt to whoever will treat you for it. üíû
- ***Note:** If a reward is **unable to be redeemed** (not enough points, zero quantity), the Redeem button will show red and be unclickable.*
- ***Note:** There are no refunds! All reward shop sales are final ;D .*
- ***Warning!** It is possible to **go into debt with negative points** for a program by buying rewards, then removing more stamps from the program card than there are remaining points. Debt must be made up before earning new points.*

      ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on the example with proper settings for your
   development environment.
   
4. Setup your PostgreSQL user, password, and database and make sure it matches your `.env` file.

5. Get into your pipenv, migrate your database, seed your database, and run your flask app.

   pipenv shell
   ```

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

   ```bash
   python seeder.py

6. To run the React App in development, `cd` into the `react-app` directory, then run `npm start`.

> 
> **IMPORTANT!**
>    If you add any python dependencies to your pipfiles, you'll need to regenerate your requirements.txt before deployment.
>    You can do this by running:
> 
>    ```bash
>    pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt
>    ```
> 
> **ALSO IMPORTANT!**
>    psycopg2-binary MUST remain a dev dependency because you can't install it on apline-linux.
>    There is a layer in the Dockerfile that will install psycopg2 (not binary) for us.
